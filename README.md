## About The 3 Amigos MCP

After discovering, using, and being absolutely blown away by the possibilities of Playwright MCP, I started looking around for other complementary MCP projects I could/should put together. This led me to what I call the "Three Amigos" - a powerful trio that I believe will be essential for most small to medium-sized projects I'll be building or experimenting with.

The idea was simple: combine browser automation, file system access, and database operations into one seamless container. Why? Because when you're building modern applications, you're almost always working with web interfaces, managing files, and handling data. Having all three capabilities available directly in your AI coding environment just makes sense.

I feel like moving forward most small to medium sized projects I'll be building or experimenting on will likely benefit greatly from these '3 amigos'.

*Note: A container hub build is on its way... I know this is kind of a hefty 3-headed beast to build :P*

## Meet the Amigos

üé≠ **Playwright** - The Browser Whisperer
- Full browser automation and web scraping
- Screenshot capture and visual testing
- Form filling and navigation automation
- Mobile device emulation and responsive testing
- PDF generation from web pages
- Network interception and debugging

üìÅ **Filesystem** - The File Wrangler
- File and directory operations
- Read/write access to your workspace
- Secure access control and permissions
- File watching and monitoring
- Batch file operations
- Workspace organization and management

üóÑÔ∏è **Database** - The Data Guardian
- Multi-database support (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Query execution and data management
- Database schema exploration
- Data import/export operations
- Connection pooling and optimization
- Environment-based configuration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This container provides two connection modes optimized for different deployment scenarios:

### **Command-Based Mode (Recommended for SSH/Remote)**

* **Best for**: SSH tunnels, remote servers, Cloudflare connections
* **How it works**: Client executes MCP servers directly via `docker exec`
* **Benefits**: No persistent HTTP connections, eliminates timeout issues
* **Use case**: When you're connecting over SSH or experiencing connection drops

### **HTTP Mode (Suitable for Local)**

* **Best for**: Local development, direct connections
* **How it works**: MCP servers run as HTTP services on ports 8091-8093
* **Benefits**: Standard MCP protocol, familiar HTTP endpoints
* **Use case**: When running locally without network issues

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed
* Cursor or VS Code with MCP support

### 1\. Clone and Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/honestlai/3AmigosMCP.git
cd 3AmigosMCP
docker compose up -d
```

### 2\. Verify Everything is Working

```bash
./test-mcps.sh
```

### 3\. Configure Your MCP Client

#### For Command-Based Mode (SSH/Remote Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Playwright_MCP": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-i",
        "3amigosmcp",
        "npx",
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless",
        "--isolated"
      ]
    },
    "Filesystem_MCP": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-i",
        "3amigosmcp",
        "npx",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/workspace"
      ]
    },
    "Database_MCP": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-i",
        "3amigosmcp",
        "npx",
        "@ahmetbarut/mcp-database-server",
        "--database",
        "/data/data.db"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### For HTTP Mode (Local Development)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Playwright_MCP": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8091/mcp",
      "retryDelay": 1000,
      "maxRetries": 20,
      "timeout": 60000
    },
    "Filesystem_MCP": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8092/mcp",
      "retryDelay": 1000,
      "maxRetries": 20,
      "timeout": 60000
    },
    "Database_MCP": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8093/mcp",
      "retryDelay": 1000,
      "maxRetries": 20,
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Browser Automation with Playwright

```javascript
// Navigate to a website
await browser.navigate({ url: "https://example.com" });

// Take a screenshot
await browser.take_screenshot({ 
  filename: "screenshot.png",
  fullPage: true 
});

// Fill a form
await browser.type({ 
  element: "input[name='username']", 
  text: "myuser" 
});
```

### File Operations with Filesystem

```javascript
// Read a file
const content = await filesystem.readFile({ path: "config.json" });

// Write a file
await filesystem.writeFile({ 
  path: "output.txt", 
  content: "Hello, World!" 
});

// List directory contents
const files = await filesystem.listDir({ path: "/workspace" });
```

### Database Operations

```javascript
// Execute a query
const results = await database.query({ 
  sql: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true" 
});

// Insert data
await database.execute({ 
  sql: "INSERT INTO logs (message, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?)",
  params: ["User logged in", new Date().toISOString()]
});
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright
  - NODE_ENV=production
```

### Port Mapping

```yaml
ports:
  - "8091:8081"  # Playwright MCP
  - "8092:8082"  # Filesystem MCP
  - "8093:8083"  # Database MCP
```

### Volume Mounts

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./workspace:/workspace  # Filesystem MCP root
  - ./data:/data            # Database storage
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Container Health

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep 3amigosmcp

# View logs
docker logs 3amigosmcp

# Health check
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' 3amigosmcp

# Test all MCPs
./test-mcps.sh
```

### Common Issues

#### Connection Drops (SSH/Remote)

* **Solution**: Switch to command-based mode
* **Why**: Eliminates persistent HTTP connections that can timeout

#### Container Won't Start

* **Check**: Port 8091-8093 availability
* **Fix**: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

#### MCP Tools Not Available

* **Check**: Client configuration
* **Verify**: Container is healthy and running
* **Test**: Run `./test-mcps.sh` to verify all MCPs

## üìà Performance

### Resource Usage

* **Memory**: ~300MB typical usage
* **CPU**: Low usage during idle
* **Network**: Minimal overhead

### Optimization Tips

* Use `--headless` mode for Playwright automation
* Enable `--isolated` for clean browser sessions
* Monitor resource usage with `docker stats`
